# Obesity Prediction Using Random Forest

## Overview
This project utilizes the Random Forest algorithm implemented in MATLAB to predict obesity based on various features collected from a dataset. The model is trained using a set of training data and then tested on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance. The results are formatted for submission to Kaggle.

## Project Structure
- **Main File**: 
  - `proj2_og.m`: The main script that performs data loading, processing, model training, and prediction.
- **Variations and Experiments**: Additional scripts that explore different modeling techniques and configurations.

- **Data Files**: The project uses two CSV files:
  - `train.csv`: Contains the training data.
  - `test.csv`: Contains the testing data.

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB installed on your machine.
- Required toolboxes for statistics and machine learning.
